# Hints for the CTF Question

---

### Hint 1 (Subtle):
Pay close attention to the phone number in the message. It might have more use than you think.

---

### Hint 2 (Moderate):
After decrypting the message, think about how old phones used to send text messages. A multitap code system might help you figure out the pin.

---

### Hint 3 (Direct):
Use a phone keypad and the multitap code system (e.g., "Y" = 999, "O" = 666) to calculate the pin for the safe. Add up the numbers from the multitap codes to get the final result.
