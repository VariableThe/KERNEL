The message sent is ``Z0x_ai11_t0F_qhv3_cL3_q1Q``
This is encrpted via the gronsfield cipher using the sender's number which is: ``13406997094``
Decrypting this using the cipher gives us `` Y0u_wi11_n0W_hav3_tH3_p1N``
Which is indicative of the fact the the pin has been trasnlated to the sender in the message itself.
A photo attached will indicate that the sender uses a phone with a numpad.
The pin is the sum of all the multitap codes for the letters of the message that was sent.
The multi tap code comes to: ``999 88 9 444 66 9 44 2 888 8 44 7 66``
Adding all of these gives us: ``2674``
Which is the pin that will be used in the flag.
