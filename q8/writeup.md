# Writeup:
---
the audio file consists of barely audible morse code, using high frequency.<br>

---
![audio file](./q(2).wav)<br>

---

When this is opened in an audio player with waveform visible<br>
observing the wave form, it is made up of different lengths of pulses in differnt groupings.<br>
converting this to morse code by translating long pulses to ``_`` and small pulses to ``.`` leads to this:<br>
morse: ``-- ....- -- ..- ...-- .---- -- ----- .-. ..... ...--``
Which translates to:<br>
``M4MU31_M0R53``<br>
a reference to the creator of morse code and a spinoff on doing the decoding 'Manually'.<br>
wrapping it:<br>
flag: `` wtfCTF{M4MU31_M0R53}``
